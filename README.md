TurBull-Encabulator
===================

Arduino code for controlling Red Bull's TurBull Encabulator board. 
For the Arduino library, head over to Google Code: https://code.google.com/p/turbull-encabulator/

A few tips (and reminders) for using the TurBull Encabulator: 

1. You'll need a 12V supply to power the RGB LED strips and another way to power the Arduino.
2. In order to solder to the LED Strips, remove the waterproof coating with a hobbyknife. Use the knife to scrape all coating off each solder pad; you won't be able to tin them otherwise.
3. Tinning the strips and connecting wires before soldering will make connecting multiple sections of LED strips together much easier.
